Vicinity Centres (VCX) continues to demonstrate resilience across its diversified retail property portfolio. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the REIT has maintained stable occupancy rates and reported consistent foot traffic in flagship centres. Management has focused on strategic refurbishments and tenant mix optimisation, positioning VCX to capitalise on shifting consumer preferences. Leasing spreads remain slightly compressed; however, rental income is supported by long WALEs and indexed leases. Looking ahead, VCX is expected to benefit from population growth and urban regeneration initiatives in core markets. Risks include exposure to discretionary retail and potential valuation softness across retail assets as interest rates remain elevated.
