The Australian Real Estate Investment Trust (A-REIT) sector demonstrated resilience in FY2024, with the A-REIT Index outperforming in the S&P/ASX200 Index by 12.1%, yielding a total return of 19.9% (BDO Australia, 2024). Despite office and diversified sectors underperforming, strong performance was driven by significant returns in various A-REIT sectors, dovish interest rate expectations, and resilience in the property market. 

Specifically, retail REITS have experienced strong recovery, with Q1 2024 tenant sales reaching $6.5 billion and portfolio occupancy nearing full capacity. Scentre Group, a major player in the sector, forecasts Funds From Operations (FFO) growth of up to 5.4% in 2024 and a distribution increase of at least 3.6% (Bristow, 2024). 

At an industry level, revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 0.9% over the past five years and is projected to reach $20.9 in 2025. REITs continue to attract investor interest, supported by superannuation fund allocations and a shift towards alternative asset classes. The industrial sector has grown its revenue share due to rising demand and upwards rent pressure. 

Looking forwards, the REIT sector is well-positioned to benefit from improving economic conditions, population growth, and elevated business confidence, which are expected to support rent hikes. Retail REITs, in particular, are buoyed by strategic asset repositioning and sustained tenant demand, reinforcing the sectorâ€™s outlook for continued expansion (Reilly, 2025). 

Overall, the retail REIT sector is benefitting from strategic asset repositioning, strong tenant demand, and investor confidence, positioning it for continued growth.
