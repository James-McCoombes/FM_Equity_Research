While Vicinity Centres is strategically positioned for long-term growth, several investment risks warrant consideration. 

Macroeconomic headwinds, such as the potential for a sharp economic downturn or sustained elevated inflation, could dampen tenant sales performance and heighten leasing risk across the portfolio. However, Vicinity’s exposure to premium, necessity-based retailers, and its strategy of maintaining staggered lease expiries across its centres, provides meaningful resilience against cyclical downturns. 

Shift in consumer preferences toward e-commerce and general structural retail disruption presents risks of uncertainty, which may structurally reduce demand for physical retail space over time. Vicinity actively mitigates this through strategic omni-channel partnerships with tenants, experiential leasing initiatives, and ongoing investment in technology-enabled shopping environments that enhance customer engagement and drive visitation. VCX's investment into  technology enabled, customer  centric  environments positions it to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and preserve foot traffic resilience.

Additionally, Vicinity’s earnings profile is concentrated among a select group of flagship assets, creating some concentration risk. However, this risk is partially offset by geographic diversification of Vicinity’s broader portfolio and the consistently strong performance of its premium centres, which continue to attract high levels of foot traffic and tenant demand. Moreover the  premium nature of these assets provide a level of  defensiveness through economic  cycles.

Capital market and funding risk are also relevant amongst the current valuation  environment with uncertainty surrounding interest rates and  property valuations. However, VCX reenforced liquidity  position, conservative gearing and robust interest rate coverage alongside active  reinvestment strategies insulate it against long term refinancing risk. Furthermore with VCX's debt being materially hedged, sensitivity to future interest rate volatility it enabled.

Finally, while share price volatility has remained modest compared to peers with a 1YR beta of  ~0.88 and above seen high correlation with the ASX200 index (~77%), VCX's defensives within the listed REIT  sector presents at highly attractive to  risk adverse investors seeking stable income  streams. Collectively, these strategies ensure Vicinity remains well-positioned to navigate emerging headwinds while continuing to deliver stable, long term returns (LSEG Stock Reports Plus, 2025).
