While Vicinity Centres is strategically positioned for long-term growth, several investment risks warrant consideration. Macroeconomic headwinds, such as the potential for a sharp economic downturn or sustained elevated inflation, could dampen tenant sales performance and heighten leasing risk across the portfolio. However, Vicinity’s exposure to premium, necessity-based retailers, and its strategy of maintaining staggered lease expiries across its centres, provides meaningful resilience against cyclical downturns. 

Another key risk is the ongoing shift in consumer preferences toward e-commerce, which may structurally reduce demand for physical retail space over time. Vicinity actively mitigates this through strategic omni-channel partnerships with tenants, experiential leasing initiatives, and ongoing investment in technology-enabled shopping environments that enhance customer engagement and drive visitation. 

Additionally, Vicinity’s earnings profile is concentrated among a select group of flagship assets, creating some concentration risk. However, this risk is partially offset by geographic diversification of Vicinity’s broader portfolio and the consistently strong performance of its premium centres, which continue to attract high levels of foot traffic and tenant demand. Collectively, these strategies ensure Vicinity remains well-positioned to navigate emerging headwinds while continuing to deliver stable, long-term returns.
