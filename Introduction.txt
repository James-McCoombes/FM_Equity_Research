This report provides an in-depth valuation of Vicinity Centres, an Australian Real Estate Investment Trust specialising in the ownership and management of Australian shopping centres. Despite macroeconomic pressures, VCX delivered resilient earning in FY2024, supported by 4.1% comparable Net Property Income (NPI) growth and strong net profit after tax ($547.1M). Strategic repositioning towards premium, high-performing assets, such as acquisition of Lakeside Joondalup and complete control of Chatwood Chase, was funded through $550M in non-core divestments at a 9% premium. With a strong balance sheet, disciplined capital management, and a shift in focus towards premiumisation, Vicinity Centres is well-positioned to benefit from structural retail trends and an improving macroeconomic outlook. VCXâ€™s commitment to ESG initiatives and sustainable income growth is at the centre of their long-term strategy.
