Australia’s current economic landscape presents a diversified outlook for REITS. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded Australia’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.6% from 2.1%, citing global trade tensions and domestic economic challenge. Inflation is expected to rise from 2.0% to 2.5%, potentially impacting consumer spending patterns and, by extension, retail REIT performance (Jackson, 2025).

Despite these challenges the RBA has maintained the official cash rate at a steady 4.53% post increasing it by 25 basis points in Q1 FY24, creating a stable monetary environment that supports long-term financing and investment strategies for REITs. While international central banks, such as the European Central Bank have shifted to easing, advanced economies are still navigating through the tail end of pandemic-induced inflationary pressures (LDB, 2025).

Australia narrowly avoided recession in 2024, with GDP growth of just 1.5%, significantly below the historical average of 3.35%. Headline annualised inflation eased substantially from a peak in 7.8% in Q4 FY2022 to 3.1%. This moderation in inflation has provided a degree of consumer relief, however, the cost-of-living crisis, specifically the housing crisis, continues to persist, with house rents rising to 11.1% and units rents by 8.6% year-on-year (Feng, 2024).  

However, these conditions incited legislative and investment shifts, including the strive for Build-to-Rent (BtR) projects and asset reallocations. Various A-REITS have taken advantage of the stable environment to restructure, refinance, or issue capital, positioning themselves ahead of expected monetary easing in the coming financial year. 

Looking forward, easing inflation and stable interest rates are expected to support household disposable income and discretionary spending across FY2025 – directly benefitting Vicinity Centres’ lifestyle and fashion tenants. Tourism recovery provides further upsides, specifically for leading destinations like Chadstone and CBD centres. Low unemployment and improving wage growth create a cautiously optimistic macroeconomic backdrop for retail REITs.
