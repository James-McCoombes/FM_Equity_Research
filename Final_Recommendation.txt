Based on our valuation and industry analysis, we issue a HOLD recommendation for Vicinity Centres (VCX), with a target price of $2.36, representing a modest 4.4% upside from the current share price of $2.26.
Vicinityâ€™s strategic repositioning toward premium and resilient retail, disciplined capital management, and focus on mixed-use development initiatives provide a strong foundation for long-term value creation. Additionally, a stable interest rate environment and recovering discretionary spending trends offer supportive tailwinds for flagship centres such as Chadstone and key CBD locations.
However, near-term upside appears limited, with macroeconomic headwinds, evolving consumer preferences toward e-commerce, and asset concentration risk presenting challenges to earnings momentum. While Vicinity remains fundamentally sound, we believe the current valuation appropriately reflects both its strengths and potential risks.
We recommend maintaining exposure, with periodic reassessment aligned with earnings updates and leasing performance across leading centres.
